          "(1925-2017) Robert Owens was a composer and pianist born in Dennison, Texas. He began composing at the age of 8 and playing publicly at 10, then under the piano instruction of Genevieve Longrus. After a public school education in Berkeley, California, Owens went to Paris, studying piano with Alfred Cortot and Jules Gentil at the École de Musique, where he received the Diplome de Perfection in piano. Although he has had several academic positions in the United States, he has been particularly active through Europe and moved to Munich. Owens' work appears in anthologies of songs of African American composers but has not been widely recorded or performed. Owens is the recipient of a commendation from the National Association of Negro Musicians and the Preisträger International Lifetime Achievement Award from AnDante Kulturmagazin. In 2009, the National Opera Association recognized Owens with the Legacy Award for lifetime achievement in opera."

In this insightful biography, Marva Griffin Carter offers the first definitive look at this pivotal life's story, drawing on both Cook's unfinished autobiography and his wife Abbie's memoir. <br /><br />A violin virtuoso, Cook studied at Oberlin College (his parents' alma mater), Berlin's Hochschule für Musik with Joseph Joachim, and New York's National Conservatory of Music with Antonin Dvorak. Cook wrote music for a now-lost production of <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> for the Chicago World's Fair of 1893, and then devoted the majority of his career to black musical comedies due to limited opportunities available to him as a black composer. He was instrumental in showcasing his Southern Syncopated Orchestra in the prominent concert halls of the United States and Europe, even featuring New Orleans clarinetist Sidney Bechet, who later introduced European audiences to authentic blues. Once mentored by Frederick Douglas, Will Marion Cook went on to mentor Duke Ellington, paving the path for orchestral concert jazz. <br /><br />Through interpretive and musical analyses, Carter traces Cook's successful evolution from minstrelsy to musical theater. Written with his collaborator, the distinguished poet Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Cook's musicals infused American Musical Theater with African-American music, consequently altering the direction of American popular music. Cook's <em>In Dahomey</em>, hailed by Gerald Bordman as \"one of the most important events in American Musical Theater history,\" was the first full-length Broadway musical to be written and performed by blacks. <br /><br />Alongside his accomplishments, Carter reveals Cook's contentious side-a man known for his aggressiveness, pride, and constant quarrels, who became his own worst enemy in regards to his career. Carter further sets Cook's life against the backdrop of the changing cultural and social milieu: the black theatrical tradition, white audiences' reaction to black performers, and the growing consciousness and sophistication of blacks in the arts, especially music.</p>",

He left before finishing; instead, he studied composition at Oberlin Conservatory of Music. He was a student of George Whitefield Chadwick and later Edgard Varèse and wrote over 150 compositions, including operas, ballets, symphonies, chamber works, and arrangements of folk themes, plus instrumental, choral, and solo vocal works. He played the violin, cello, and oboe. Still has nine honorary degrees. He's often referred to as \"the dean of African American composers.” He was the first African American to conduct an American orchestra; to have a symphony played by a major orchestra; to conduct a major symphony orchestra in the United States; to direct a major symphony orchestra in the Deep South; to conduct a major American network radio orchestra; to have an opera produced by a major American company; and to have an opera televised over a national network in the United States (after his death).</p><p><a href=\"http://www.williamgrantstill.com\">Visit his site</a>.</p>"

          "(1925-2017) Robert Owens was a composer and pianist born in Dennison, Texas. He began composing at the age of 8 and playing publicly at 10, then under the piano instruction of Genevieve Longrus. After a public school education in Berkeley, California, Owens went to Paris, studying piano with Alfred Cortot and Jules Gentil at the École de Musique, where he received the Diplome de Perfection in piano. Although he has had several academic positions in the United States, he has been particularly active through Europe and moved to Munich. Owens' work appears in anthologies of songs of African American composers but has not been widely recorded or performed. Owens is the recipient of a commendation from the National Association of Negro Musicians and the Preisträger International Lifetime Achievement Award from AnDante Kulturmagazin. In 2009, the National Opera Association recognized Owens with the Legacy Award for lifetime achievement in opera."

          "(1875-1912) Samuel Coleridge-Taylor was a composer and conductor trained and educated in England and lived in England all his life. He was exposed to Black culture through readings, research, and attending the annual London concerts of the Fisk Jubilee Singers. He was referred to by white New York musicians as the \"African Mahler\" when he toured the United States in the early 1900s. Entering the Royal College of Music at the age of 15, he was originally a violin major and piano minor, switching to composition and studying under Charles Villers Stanford. He became friends with Paul Laurence Dunbar when Dunbar visited England."

          "(1876-1951) John Alden Carpenter graduated from Harvard University in 1897, having studied composition with John Knowles Paine. He had a brief period of study with Edward Elgar in Rome in 1906 and lessons in theory with Bernhard Ziehm from 1908 to 1912. Even though he seemed to be a conservative composer influenced by early 20th-century French music, Carpenter incorporated jazz rhythms into his <em>Concertino for Piano and Orchestra </em>(1917) and into his ballets <em>Krazy Kat: A Jazz Pantomime </em>(1922) and <em>Skyscrapers </em>(1926), his best-known work. Carpenter was the recipient of five honorary doctorates. In 1947, he won the gold medal of the National Institute of Arts and Letters."

          "(1866-1949) Harry Thacker \"H.T.\" Burleigh was an African American composer, arranger, and performer. He learned plantation melodies from his maternal grandfather, who had been a slave. Burleigh won an 1892 scholarship to the National Conservatory of Music in New York, which was then headed by Dvorak. With the urging of Dvorak, he began to publish African American spirituals in 1911. In 1916, he published his collection <em>Jubilee Songs of the United States.</em> His collection was so well-received that he started writing his own songs, along with choral and chamber compositions — over 200 works in all. Additionally, Burleigh was the baritone soloist for St. George’s Episcopal Church in New York from 1894 to 1946 and won acclaim as a recitalist, sometimes accompanying himself on piano. He toured Europe and gave performances for royalty. He actively performed until 1946."

          "(1925-2017) Robert Owens was a composer and pianist born in Dennison, Texas. He began composing at the age of 8 and playing publicly at 10, then under the piano instruction of Genevieve Longrus. After a public school education in Berkeley, California, Owens went to Paris, studying piano with Alfred Cortot and Jules Gentil at the École de Musique, where he received the Diplome de Perfection in piano. Although he has had several academic positions in the United States, he has been particularly active through Europe and moved to Munich. Owens' work appears in anthologies of songs of African American composers but has not been widely recorded or performed. Owens is the recipient of a commendation from the National Association of Negro Musicians and the Preisträger International Lifetime Achievement Award from AnDante Kulturmagazin. In 2009, the National Opera Association recognized Owens with the Legacy Award for lifetime achievement in opera."

The original intent was not to present a chronological representation of Dunbar’s life and career, but something more closely related to an impressionistic representation of his work. Thirteen poems are used with two being used at the beginning of the work and reprised at the end. This work employs two sopranos, one tenor and one baritone.</p>\r\n<p>It begins with <em>Ode To Ethiopia, </em>and slowly embraces <em>Compensation. </em>It is at once a hymn to beginnings and a praise to struggle and the commitment to survival.<strong> </strong>An allusion is made to Dunbar suggesting that he is born with a gift that embraces and enlightens and influences the lives of African Americans.</p>\r\n<p>This work pauses to acknowledge the brevity of Dunbar’s lifetime (1872—1906) a mere thirty-three years. Still, the poet was able to craft a wide number of voices who spoke of love and its importance in the lives of men and women who are remembered as vibrant beings in his poetry. Dunbar’s use of dialect is one of the memorable attributes of his poetry. He uses it to great effect to describe the emotion the man feels as his mind moves ever closer to the dances that occupy black life.</p>\r\n<p>He musically takes a turn towards tenderness when one of the singers sings a lullaby <em>Little Brown Baby. </em>It is one of those moments which we know invokes love which is so closely attached to passion. It is here that the audience encounters <em>A Negro Love Song. </em>It is a rhythmical delight that repeats itself, over and over again, in amusing ways, and which spills playfully over into gossip and noisiness. Dunbar seems ever aware of the subtle rhythms which are pervasive in the African American community.</p>\r\n<p>This theatrepiece is a pastiche of love that is attentive, passionate, and playful, but then it turns its attention to the sacred as well as the secular. These two elements are intrinsically bound together in the black community. The movement is one that goes back and forth before either one becomes too serious at the expense of the other. It is at this juncture that we are presented with someone who has to acknowledge that he is at the least accountability for what he does in the community, which leads directly into a church hymn and a sermon. The entire quartet is employed in this section of the work.</p>\r\n<p>The penultimate section of <em>Common Ground </em>focuses on the ever—present heroes and leaders of the black community. It is here that the singers focus on <em>He Had His Dream. </em>Here the drama focuses on the heroic and a sense of determination.</p>\r\n<p>The reprise bring us full circle back to the beginning, and the necessity for understanding when, where and how we began on this worldly journey and what it may require before its conclusion is reached.</p>",

        "comments": "<p><em><strong>Synopsis contributed by Jeff Arwady: </strong></em></p>\r\n<p>At its core, Dunbar’s Mask is about hiding one’s true feelings to either assimilate or to avoid the often too bitter alternatives that honesty elicits. When Dunbar wrote of this concept, he applied it to the culture of slavery that helped define the American South until the Civil War. If slaves complained, or showed any signs of rebellion, they were severely beaten.  Thus, slaves HAD to “wear the mask.” If they let their true feelings shine through, they would risk severe injury or even death. Although that is one aspect of Dunbar’s Mask, the applications for the author were far more personal. While slaves wore the mask for survival, most people today wear it for a very different reason.  </p>\r\n<p>We as human beings hide ourselves behind this mask, as though concealing some grotesque human disfigurement.  Whether we do this because we don’t actually like who we are, or because of some sense of inadequacy is unclear.  What is clear is that the judgement of others based on one’s own personal standards is ultimately self-defeating.  Dunbar shows us that the more one is judged or persecuted, the more one hides behind the mask.  Thus, the more one seeks to find “truth” through interrogation, mistrust, and judgment, the less of it one actually finds.  In the end, our culture itself is what is lost.  The American experiment is about freedom and self-determination; and to a further extent, the freedom to express one’s personality.  </p>\r\n<p>Why Dunbar’s poem is still relevant today has to do with how oppressive and brutal human enslavement is.  While we can thankfully say that our physical bodies are no longer enslaved, are we to really be satisfied?  Is a human being simply a collection of chemicals and compounds organized in a particular way, or is there more?  If, like most humans, one believes that there must be more to us all then the sum of our parts, then one must admit that the oppressive nature of enslavement that makes Dunbar’s Mask relevant is not the physical enslavement at all, neigh, instead it is and always has been the enslavement of the soul itself.   Can any one person honestly say that they do not believe their own soul, there own self, is not enslaved in some way(s) by the oppressive culture of conformity that plagues the modern American?  If one has ever experienced the total dysfunction resulting from “being whom they really are”, then one must concede that society itself only functions because millions of people wear Dunbar’s Mask.  Without it, yes, there would be intellectual chaos for a time.  However, there would also be truth and perhaps, in a scenario that could be too much to hope for, progress.  As the prospect of that scenario grows fainter and dimmer with each passing generation, the belief in Dunbar’s Mask becomes a terrible burden, a terrible truth that, for this author, causes great lament.  </p>\r\n<p>“The Mask”, therefore, is ultimately a lament for humanity.  While it explores Dunbar’s Mask as a mysterious and somewhat ominous concept, it ultimately and inevitably succumbs to its ramifications.  However the work had to be completed.  This excerpt from the author’s personal notes provides some insights:</p>\r\n<p>“Sitting at an old bar piano, that had been with our family ever since my Father’s restaurant failed, I began to play.  I played for six days.  Anything besides the music I was composing became ill-important.  School was an interruption of my work.  Even primal things like eating and sleeping lost all of their value.  I had become inspired to the point of obsession.  Finally, on a Saturday, I finished “The Mask.”  It was in a very rough piano score but it was there.  It was a fantasy of Dunbar’s Mask.  Themes of the Mask itself, the human brain, emotional turmoil, all were engulfed in my ten-minute score. “</p>\r\n<p>The transition from piano score to a symphonic band score occurs one fateful day when former Algonac High School Band Director Gregory Nimtz heard the author playing the piano score in the Algonac High School Band room.  Seeing some potential, Mr. Nimtz commissioned the author to create a symphonic band version of the work.  The work is in two movements - the first “A Brief Perspective” was written specifically with a symphonic band in mind and serves as an introduction or intellectual setting for Dunbar’s Mask.  The second movement is true to the original piano score and attempts to expose Dunbar’s Mask, provide social commentary, and ultimately to lament American society for the insistence of such psychological devices.  </p>\r\n<p>While certainly not a “master work”, “The Mask” nevertheless aligns itself with Dunbar’s legacy.  It attempts to show us part of the human condition, and to suggest, ultimately, that perhaps there is a better way forward.  The hope of the author is that listeners will be self-reflective about their own masks, and that somehow they will move past them to create a common future where such devices are no longer necessary.  Such a future would only owe its creation to that of Paul Laurence Dunbar’s courageous and apt insights into the very nature of the human soul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Whenever I mention “Dunbar’s Mask,” I am referring to the poem “We Wear the Mask” by Paul Laurence Dunbar.  This was the poem that inspired me to write “The Mask” during my junior year of high school.  I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Mr. Stephen Young.  Mr. Young was my American literature and A.P. United States History teacher at Algonac High School; but he was so much more.  His undying dedication to teaching and his never-yielding pursuit to bring me culture helped to make me a more well-rounded individual.  I am specifically grateful for his mandatory reading of “We Wear the Mask.”  Without this reading, I would never have been inspired to write the piece that I did.  The symphonic piece, as well as this written overview, are dedicated to Stephen Young; for this exciting flame of culture and knowledge is one that will never truly be extinguished. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><em></em></p>",

They fuss with the children and one another as they scramble to prepare for a visit from Parson Jones and other members of the community. Uncle Eph mutes the Village Gossip with “Christmas Fun Is In The Air” and inquires about the presence of Parthenia.</p>\r\n<p>Uncle Eph pulls Parthenia in to the center of the crowd and she reprises “I’m the colored girl from Vassar” and “Lovers Lane” both from the successful, <em>Clorindy: Origin of the Cakewalk</em>.</p>\r\n<p>After Aunt Chloe insists that Uncle Eph provide hospitality to their guest and sends him out for food, Darky Dan arrives. He shares a wishbone with the blushing Parthenia and informs her that after hanging it in her doorway, the first man to enter would be her husband. As she hangs the wishbone, a package arrives for her. The visitors gather to see the package and Darky Dan laments his too early-arrival. Slob Coon emerges from the box and begins his pursuit of the fair lady to whom he’d been sent. In “Hot Foot Dance” the men of the chorus push Slob Coon out after which Darky Dan falsely asserts his bravery.</p>\r\n<p>Uncle Eph returns completely intoxicated. He’s collected the possum and gin as directed by Aunt Chloe, but consumed all of the gin. He skirts any criticism with “Possum is De Best Meat After All” and dances with Parthenia to the cake-walk song.</p>",

Paul Laurence Dunbar is historically important because he was the first successful African-American poet and his work has inspired generations especially in the 1920s. The opera follows their relationship from Dunbar’s initial letter of introduction to Alice to their final estrangement and Paul’s imminent death at his home in Dayton, Ohio.</p>\r\n<p>The work is scored for a twelve-piece chamber orchestra and is approximately two hours in length.<em>The Mask in the Mirror</em> was first performed by Trilogy: An Opera Company in August 2012. Trilogy, of Newark, New Jersey, is the only fully functioning Afro-centric opera company in the United States.</p>",

          "(1873-1954) John Rosamond Johnson was a composer, conductor, pianist, and actor. He studied at the New England Conservatory in Boston as well as briefly in Europe. He wrote the tune for \"Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing\" (1899), a song written by his brother James Weldon Johnson, which the NAACP adopted as its official song; it later became known as the \"Negro national anthem.” He toured as a vocalist with the company of Oriental America. He began his career as a music teacher in the Jacksonville, Florida, public schools but in 1899 moved to New York with brother James to pursue a career in show business. He teamed up with Robert Cole to write and publish more than 200 songs (some along with brother James). In 1912, Oscar Hammerstein appointed Johnson as musical director of the Grand Opera House in London. In 1918 while in New York, he and his wife started the Music School Settlement for Colored People. In 1935, Johnson appeared in the original production of the American opera <em>Porgy and Bess.</em>"

          "(1925-2017) Robert Owens was a composer and pianist born in Dennison, Texas. He began composing at the age of 8 and playing publicly at 10, then under the piano instruction of Genevieve Longrus. After a public school education in Berkeley, California, Owens went to Paris, studying piano with Alfred Cortot and Jules Gentil at the École de Musique, where he received the Diplome de Perfection in piano. Although he has had several academic positions in the United States, he has been particularly active through Europe and moved to Munich. Owens' work appears in anthologies of songs of African American composers but has not been widely recorded or performed. Owens is the recipient of a commendation from the National Association of Negro Musicians and the Preisträger International Lifetime Achievement Award from AnDante Kulturmagazin. In 2009, the National Opera Association recognized Owens with the Legacy Award for lifetime achievement in opera."

O happy bird, of heart most gay To sing when skies are gray! When the clouds are full, And the tempest master Lets the loud winds sweep From his bosom deep Like heralds of some dire disaster, Then the heart alone To itself makes moan; And the songs come slow, While the tears fall fleeter, And silence than song by far seems sweeter. Oh, few are they along the way Who sing when skies are gray!</p>",

          "(1878-1927) Ernest R. Ball was a composer and vocalist from Cleveland who received his formal training at the Cleveland Conservatory. In 1905 in New York City, he was given a few verses written by then-state Senator James J. Walker, who later became famous as the dapper New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker. Ball put one of the verses to music, calling it \"Will You Love Me In December as You Do In May?\" It became a national hit. Beginning in 1906, Ball had a dual career, writing songs and singing them himself on vaudeville stages. At first, he worked alone but later shared billing with his second wife, Maude Lambert. In 1907, he was a charter member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and signed a contract with Witmark Music as a demonstrator and house composer. Ball was most famous for composing the music for the song \"When Irish Eyes Sre Smiling\" in 1912. He collaborated with several lyricists including Chauncey Olcott, George Graff, Darl MacBoyle, J. Keirn Brennan, James J. Walker, Arthur Penn, Annelu Burns, and David Reed."

          "(1875-1912) Samuel Coleridge-Taylor was a composer and conductor trained and educated in England and lived in England all his life. He was exposed to Black culture through readings, research, and attending the annual London concerts of the Fisk Jubilee Singers. He was referred to by white New York musicians as the \"African Mahler\" when he toured the United States in the early 1900s. Entering the Royal College of Music at the age of 15, he was originally a violin major and piano minor, switching to composition and studying under Charles Villers Stanford. He became friends with Paul Laurence Dunbar when Dunbar visited England."

          "(1925-2017) Robert Owens was a composer and pianist born in Dennison, Texas. He began composing at the age of 8 and playing publicly at 10, then under the piano instruction of Genevieve Longrus. After a public school education in Berkeley, California, Owens went to Paris, studying piano with Alfred Cortot and Jules Gentil at the École de Musique, where he received the Diplome de Perfection in piano. Although he has had several academic positions in the United States, he has been particularly active through Europe and moved to Munich. Owens' work appears in anthologies of songs of African American composers but has not been widely recorded or performed. Owens is the recipient of a commendation from the National Association of Negro Musicians and the Preisträger International Lifetime Achievement Award from AnDante Kulturmagazin. In 2009, the National Opera Association recognized Owens with the Legacy Award for lifetime achievement in opera."

          "(1862-1901) Ethelbert Woodbridge Nevin was a pianist and composer from Pennsylvania. Nevin's father, Robert, provided for Nevin both vocal and instrumental instruction. He took him abroad for two years of travel and music study in Dresden, Germany, under Von Böhme. Nevin studied piano for two years in Boston under Benjamin Johnson Lang and composition under Stephen A. Emery. He also studied in Berlin from 1884 to 1886 under Karl Klindoworth. In 1892, he went to Paris, where he taught singing  and coached many American and French artists for the operatic stage. His early songs in English and German were influenced by Schubert and Schumann. His later pieces, in a lighter style, include the much-loved “Rosary” (1898) and “Mighty Lak’ a Rose” (1900). His best-known piano piece was \"Narcissus\" (1891), from <em>Water Scenes.</em>"

          "(1875-1912) Samuel Coleridge-Taylor was a composer and conductor trained and educated in England and lived in England all his life. He was exposed to Black culture through readings, research, and attending the annual London concerts of the Fisk Jubilee Singers. He was referred to by white New York musicians as the \"African Mahler\" when he toured the United States in the early 1900s. Entering the Royal College of Music at the age of 15, he was originally a violin major and piano minor, switching to composition and studying under Charles Villers Stanford. He became friends with Paul Laurence Dunbar when Dunbar visited England."

          "(1869-1944) Will Marion Cook studied violin at Oberlin College when he was 15. He also attended the National Conservatory of Music in New York, where he studied with Dvorak and John White. He played professionally at Oberlin, but his solo career was short-lived. He also wrote musicals but is best-known for his songs that represent an original, distinctive handling of Black folk elements in song composition. He collaborated with Paul Laurence Dunbar while composing the musical sketch comedy <em>Clorindy, the Origin of the Cakewalk </em>(1898), which was Cook’s first composed score."

          "(1875-1912) Samuel Coleridge-Taylor was a composer and conductor trained and educated in England and lived in England all his life. He was exposed to Black culture through readings, research, and attending the annual London concerts of the Fisk Jubilee Singers. He was referred to by white New York musicians as the \"African Mahler\" when he toured the United States in the early 1900s. Entering the Royal College of Music at the age of 15, he was originally a violin major and piano minor, switching to composition and studying under Charles Villers Stanford. He became friends with Paul Laurence Dunbar when Dunbar visited England."
